The code you've provided is a command-line tool that interacts with the Ollama API to generate text based on a given prompt. It supports various features such as tool invocation, context merging, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

### Key Features:

1. **Tool Invocation:**
   - The tool can invoke external scripts or commands specified in a configuration file (`bob/tools.json`). Each tool has a `description`, `command`, and `args` field.
   - The tool's output is captured and can be included in the conversation context.

2. **Context Management:**
   - The tool can merge the output of invoked tools into the context used for generating the final response. This can be done as a system message or as part of the user's message.
   - The position of the tool's output relative to the user's question can be configured (before, after, or as part of the question).

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - If configured, the tool can search for similar text in a local vector store (using the `daphnia` library) based on the user's question.
   - The similar text is used to augment the context before generating the final response.

4. **Configuration:**
   - The tool uses a configuration file (`bob/config.json`) to specify various parameters such as the model to use, the output file path, and additional messages to include in the conversation.

5. **Streaming:**
   - The tool supports streaming of the generated text, allowing the user to see the response as it is being generated.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The tool includes basic error handling for file operations and API requests.

### Usage:

To use the tool, you would typically run it from the command line and provide the necessary configuration files. The tool would then interact with the Ollama API to generate a response based on the user's input and any additional context or tools specified.

### Example Workflow:

1. **User Input:**
   - The user provides a question or prompt.

2. **Tool Invocation:**
   - The tool checks if any tools are configured to be invoked. If so, it runs the tools and captures their output.

3. **Context Preparation:**
   - The tool prepares the context for the response. This may include the output from invoked tools and any similar text found in the vector store.

4. **API Request:**
   - The tool sends a request to the Ollama API with the prepared context and the user's input.

5. **Response Generation:**
   - The API generates a response, which is streamed back to the user.

6. **Output:**
   - The final response is saved to a specified output file.

This tool is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to customize the behavior through configuration files and extend its functionality with additional tools.
