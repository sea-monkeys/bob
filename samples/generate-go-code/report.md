To generate the specified file structure and populate the files with the given content, you can use the following Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {
	// Define the base directory
	baseDir := "samples/rust-tutorial"

	// Create directories
	dirs := []string{
		filepath.Join(baseDir, ".bob"),
		filepath.Join(baseDir, "content"),
	}

	for _, dir := range dirs {
		if err := os.MkdirAll(dir, 0755); err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error creating directory %s: %v\n", dir, err)
			return
		}
	}

	// Define files and their contents
	files := map[string]string{
		filepath.Join(baseDir, ".bob", ".env"): `
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
LLM=qwen2.5:1.5b
EMBEDDINGS_LLM=snowflake-arctic-embed:33m
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, ".bob", "instructions.md"): `
You are a useful AI agent.
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, ".bob", "rag.json"): `
{
    "chunkSize": 1024,
    "chunkOverlap": 256,
    "similarityThreshold": 0.3,
    "maxSimilarity": 10
}
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, ".bob", "settings.json"): `
{
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "repeat_last_n": 2
}
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, "content", "content.txt"): `
Content goes here.
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, "prompt.md"): `
Put your prompt here.
`,
		filepath.Join(baseDir, "README.md"): `
# The name of the project
`,
	}

	// Create and write to files
	for file, content := range files {
		if err := ioutil.WriteFile(file, []byte(content), 0644); err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error writing to file %s: %v\n", file, err)
			return
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("File structure created successfully.")
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Directory Creation**: The `os.MkdirAll` function is used to create the necessary directories. The `0755` permission mode is used to ensure that the directories are readable, writable, and executable by the owner, and readable and executable by others.

2. **File Creation and Writing**: The `ioutil.WriteFile` function is used to create and write content to the files. The `0644` permission mode is used to ensure that the files are readable and writable by the owner, and readable by others.

3. **File Paths**: The `filepath.Join` function is used to construct file paths in a way that is compatible with the operating system.

4. **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling to print any errors that occur during directory creation or file writing.

To run this code, save it to a file (e.g., `main.go`), and execute it using the Go command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will create the specified directory structure and populate the files with the given content.
