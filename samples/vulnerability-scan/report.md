VULNERABILITY_DETECTED

The source code contains a vulnerability related to the `eval` function. The `eval` function can execute arbitrary code, which can lead to security issues such as code injection.

**Line 15**: `res.send(eval(req.body.cmd))`

**Fix**: Replace `eval(req.body.cmd)` with a safer alternative, such as using a library like `child_process` to execute commands securely.

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

app.get('/danger', (req, res) => {
  exec(req.body.cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      return res.status(500).send(stderr);
    }
    res.send(stdout);
  });
});
```

**Explanation**: The `exec` function from the `child_process` module is used to execute commands securely. It runs the command in a separate process and captures the output, which is then sent back to the client. This approach prevents the execution of arbitrary code and mitigates the risk of code injection.
