LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify and standardize working with language models. It includes several key components and a comprehensive documentation suite to help users build and deploy intelligent language applications. Here's a breakdown of its main components and features:

### Components and Modules

1. **Model I/O**:
   - **Prompt Management**: Tools for creating, managing, and using prompt templates.
   - **Chat Models**: A consistent interface for chat models across different providers, including tool-calling and structured output.
   - **Model Providers**: Support for various model providers, such as Cohere, Anthropic, Anthropic Claude, and more.

2. **Retrieval**:
   - **Data Loading**: Tools for loading data from various sources.
   - **Text Splitting**: Tools for preparing and splitting text data.
   - **Search/Retrieval**: Tools for searching and retrieving data from a corpus for use in the generation step.
